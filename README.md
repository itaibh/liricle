```

after that you can load the lyric by calling `init` method like the example below:

load from url:

```javascript
liricle.init({
    url: "your-lrc-file.lrc"
});
```

load from text:

```javascript
liricle.init({
    text: "[00:00.00] your lrc text"
});
```

> you can call `init` method many times if you want to update the lyric.  

### Syncronization

you can sync the lyric by calling `sync` method

``` javascript
liricle.sync(time, offset);
```

this method has 2 parameters:
- `time`: current time from audio player or something else in seconds.
  - required: **yes**
  - type: **number** 

- `offset`: the lyric offset in seconds (optional). this is used to set the lyric speed.
  - required: **no**
  - type: **number**
  - default: **0**

### Listen to event

you can add event listener by calling `on` method

``` javascript
liricle.on(event, callback);
```

liricle has 2 events `init` and `sync` that you can listen. for example, see the code below:

listen `init` event:

``` javascript
liricle.on("init", (data) => {
      // data => { Object } contain parsed lrc data.
});
```

listen `sync` event:

``` javascript
liricle.on("sync", (line, word) => {
      // line => { Object | null } contain current line data { time, text, index } or null
      // word => { Object | null } contain current line data { time, text, index } or null
});
```
